<h1> NUke the Zombie üßü <h1/>
 
  This game was develop as a part of my College project in python language.
  
# <h2> Overview: </h2>



In ‚ÄúNuke the Zombies‚Äù, there will be random number of enemies in the game generated randomly in a grid. The player will have to calculate the coordinates in the grid (which will be the input) to drop the bomb to kill the enemies. I am giving the player limited number of bombs to wipe out the enemies or else, the player will lose. This is the basic mechanism of the game.
As this game is not finalized yet, I am not planning to go on a detail because I am sure that there will be a lot of changes while submitting the final project, but I am planning to place a timer so that the game must be played with in a certain timeframe. Talking about the difficulty of the game, the player needs to have a simple mathematical knowledge to play this game. The goal of this game is to make mathematics a fun way to learn. Kids will learn to use co-ordinates in this game. I also am planning to add levels which will include multiplication, division, subtraction and many more. But it is still a concept that I am working on.
